            <h3>About Us : </h3>
            <p>
             “Organics with love”,  GROCETERIA's slogan, articulates its belief that foods that are healthy and holistic in an ethereal sense can only be cultivated, produced and processed by healthy, happy people. Only people who do well themselves, who do not have to fight for daily survival can muster the necessary diligence and affection that is needed for the production of healthy foodstuffs – food that does not only fill one’s stomach but that is beneficial to one’s well-being.
            </p>
            <p>
                For that reason GROCETERIA considers the welfare of all those people who participate in the making of a food product. Starting with the farmers who stand at the beginning of the value chain, the employees who work for its suppliers and all the way to the GROCETERIA staff that is responsible for the processing, packaging, storage and logistics of our food products.
            </p>
            <p>
                The underlying base for all this are fair and adequate prices that GROCETERIA pays and that create adequate value at all levels. Frequent visits to its farmers and upstream suppliers – including those who are no HAND IN HAND partners – provide GROCETERIA insights into local conditions and help to establish authentic social contacts.
